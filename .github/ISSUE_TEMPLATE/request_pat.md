### Request for access to gtec API
gtec have given us permission to distribute their header file 'gAPI.h' and library 'libgUSBampAPIso.so' to support use of their hardware, but have requested that we keep track of who's using it and what for. Please give us a little bit of information below.

<!-- Please put some text in here about yourself (for example: name, institution, what you plan to use the library for. -->
