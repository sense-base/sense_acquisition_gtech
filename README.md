## Requesting access to the g.tec API
To run or develop this code you will need access to the gtec API (header file and library). g.tec have given us permission to distribute these files but have asked that
we keep track of who is using them and for what. We are currently managing access to these files using a private GitHub repository and personal access tokens. If you would 
like a personal access token please [create a new issue](https://github.com/sense-base/sense_acquisition_gtech/issues) using the `Request access for gtec API` template.
